-- Migration: Fix timezone to use Asia/Kolkata (IST) for date comparisons
-- Date: 2025-10-09
-- Description: Convert UTC timestamps to IST before extracting dates
--              This fixes the â‚¹150 difference between web and mobile

-- Drop the existing function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_dashboard_stats(date, date);

-- Recreate with IST timezone conversion

  start_date DATE DEFAULT NULL,
