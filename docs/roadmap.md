# Project Roadmap: Smart Billing System

This document outlines the development plan for the Smart Billing System. The project is structured into sequential phases, starting from initial setup to final deployment.

## **Development Rules** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Before Starting Any Feature:**
1. **ALWAYS explain what I'm going to build first**
2. **Wait for explicit approval before writing any code**
3. Show my understanding of the requirements
4. Only start development after getting confirmation

**Git Push Policy:**
- **NEVER ask if I should push to GitHub**
- **ONLY push when explicitly told: "push to github"**
- Commit changes locally, but wait for push command
- This prevents unnecessary deployments and gives control over timing

### **1. Party Invoice Count Column** üî¥ High Priority ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Description:** Display total number of invoices for each party in the party listing page

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/app/(app)/parties/columns.tsx` - Added "No. of Invoices" column with sorting
- `web/src/app/(app)/parties/use-parties.ts` - Fetch invoice count using Supabase aggregate

**Database Changes:** None (uses aggregate query)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
supabase.from('parties').select('*, invoices!party_id(count)')
```

---

### **2. Party Opening Balance** üî¥ High Priority ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Description:** Track initial balance for each party at the start

- `web/src/app/(app)/parties/[id]/page.tsx` - Display opening balance in 4-card summary
- `database/update_dashboard_stats_with_opening_balance.sql` - Updated RPC function

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE parties ADD COLUMN opening_balance DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0;
```

**Calculation Logic:**
- Total Outstanding = Opening Balance + Total Invoiced - Total Paid
- Opening balance is a ONE-TIME value set at party creation
- Never updated automatically - used only for initial offline amounts

---

### **3. Invoice Numbering System** üî¥ High Priority ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Description:** Auto-generate invoice numbers with financial year format (YYYY-YY/XXX), apply to existing and new invoices, display in PDFs

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN invoice_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_number ON invoices(invoice_number);
CREATE FUNCTION get_financial_year(invoice_date DATE) -- Calculate FY
CREATE FUNCTION generate_invoice_number(invoice_date DATE) -- Generate number
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_auto_generate_invoice_number -- Auto-generate on insert
```

**Number Generation Logic:**
- Format: **YYYY-YY/XXX** (Financial Year based)
- Financial year: April 1st to March 31st
- Examples:
  - Invoice dated April 1, 2024: `2024-25/001`
  - Invoice dated March 31, 2025: `2024-25/002`
  - Invoice dated April 1, 2025: `2025-26/001` (counter resets)

- Automatic payment record creation on invoice submission
- Validation for partial payments (0 < amount < total)

**UI Features:**
- Quick Entry button with ‚ö° Zap icon in header
