# Mobile App Roadmap: PlasticMart Mobile

This document outlines the development plan for the PlasticMart Mobile application. The mobile app will share the same Supabase database with the web application and provide a simplified, layman-friendly interface for core business operations.

## **Development Approach** üöÄ
**Phase-by-Phase Implementation:**
1. I build one feature at a time following this roadmap
2. You test the feature in your environment
3. Once approved, we move to the next task
4. This ensures quality and allows for feedback at each step

### **Important Development Rules** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Before Starting Any Feature:**
1. **ALWAYS explain what I'm going to build first**
2. **Wait for explicit approval before writing any code**
3. Show my understanding of the requirements
4. Only start development after getting confirmation

**Git Push Policy:**
- **NEVER ask if I should push to GitHub**
- **ONLY push when explicitly told: "push to github"**
- Commit changes locally, but wait for push command
- This prevents unnecessary deployments and gives control over timing

## **App Overview**

**Target Users:** Business owners, field staff, and anyone who needs to create invoices and manage basic data on-the-go
**Platform:** Cross-platform (iOS & Android) using **Flutter**
**Database:** Shared Supabase database with web application
**Sync:** Real-time bidirectional sync with web app
**State Management:** Provider (ChangeNotifier)

---

## **Core Concept: ~~Two Operating Modes~~ Single Unified Mode**

### **~~Basic Mode (Default)~~ Complete Feature Set (Current)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All core features implemented
- **Target:** All users (laymen, field staff, business owners)
- **Focus:** Complete business management with clean, simple UI
- **Features:** Full CRUD operations, invoicing, payments, PDF generation, dashboard analytics, party reports

### **~~Advanced Mode (Settings Toggle)~~ Future Enhancements (Deferred)**
- **Status:** üìÖ DEFERRED - Will be implemented based on user feedback
- **Original Plan:** Advanced reporting, bulk operations, complex analytics
- **Decision:** Keep app simple and focused. Advanced features will be added incrementally based on actual business needs
- **Theme Toggle:** The Settings toggle now controls Light/Dark mode instead of Basic/Advanced mode
