```

### Language Provider Implementation
```dart
class LanguageProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  Locale _locale = const Locale('en');

  Locale get locale => _locale;

  Future<void> setLocale(Locale locale) async {
    _locale = locale;
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setString('language_code', locale.languageCode);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  Future<void> loadSavedLocale() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final languageCode = prefs.getString('language_code') ?? 'en';
    _locale = Locale(languageCode);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

### Usage in Screens
```dart
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';

class MyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(l10n.settings_title),  // Translated title
      ),
      body: Text(l10n.common_loading),     // Translated content
    );
  }
}
```

### RTL Support for Urdu
```dart
MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
  supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
  locale: languageProvider.locale,
  // RTL direction automatically applied for Urdu locale
  builder: (context, child) {
    return Directionality(
      textDirection: Localizations.localeOf(context).languageCode == 'ur'
          ? TextDirection.rtl
          : TextDirection.ltr,
      child: child!,
    );
  },
);
```

### Parameter Interpolation
```dart
// For messages with dynamic values
l10n.parties_reportFor('John Doe')
// Output: "Report for John Doe"

l10n.items_removePartyPriceMessage('ABC Party')
// Output: "Remove price for ABC Party?"

l10n.settings_languageChanged('English')
// Output: "Language changed to English"
```

- Parameter interpolation uses placeholders: `{paramName}`

## Troubleshooting Guide

If issues arise, check these areas:

1. **Translations not showing?**
   - Run `flutter pub get` to regenerate localization files
   - Check that `AppLocalizations.of(context)` is not null
   - Verify translation key exists in all three ARB files

2. **RTL not working for Urdu?**
   - Check that `Directionality` widget is properly configured
   - Verify Urdu locale is 'ur' in language provider
   - Ensure `textDirection` is set based on locale

3. **Language not persisting?**
   - Check SharedPreferences is properly initialized
   - Verify `loadSavedLocale()` is called in `initState`
   - Check that language code is saved on selection

4. **Missing translations?**
   - Check for typos in translation keys
   - Verify all three ARB files have matching keys
   - Run `flutter gen-l10n` to regenerate localization files

5. **Parameter interpolation not working?**
   - Use correct placeholder syntax in ARB files: `{paramName}`
   - Add `@keyName` with placeholders definition
   - Pass parameter as named argument: `l10n.key('value')`

6. **Build errors after adding translations?**
   - Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
   - Delete `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/` folder
   - Rebuild with `flutter run`
