### 5. Invoices Screen (80%)

  - Tabs, search, empty states
  - Dialogs
  - Labels ("Bill #", status badges)
  - Tooltips

### 6. Dashboard / Other Screens
- Translation keys exist in ARB files
- Need to apply AppLocalizations import and usage

## 🎯 How to Complete Remaining Work

### For Invoices Screen:
Add to methods:
```dart
final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
```

Replace hardcoded strings with:
- Tabs: `l10n.invoices_active`, `l10n.invoices_deleted`
- Search: `l10n.invoices_searchInvoices`
- Empty: `l10n.invoices_noInvoicesYet`, `l10n.invoices_createFirstInvoice`
- Dialogs: `l10n.invoices_deleteConfirm`, `l10n.common_cancel`, etc.
- Messages: `l10n.invoices_deleteSuccess`, `l10n.invoices_restoreSuccess`
- Labels: Use invoice translation keys for "Bill #", statuses, etc.

### For Other Screens:
1. Add import: `import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';`
2. In build method: `final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;`
3. Replace hardcoded strings with corresponding `l10n.key_name`
