## 🔧 Recent Technical Work

### **Invoice Form Enhancements** (`src/app/(app)/invoices/new/invoice-form.tsx`)
- **Smart Item Filtering**: Hide already-added items from dropdown
- **Contextual Messaging**: "Item already added" vs "Create new item"
- **Full CreateItemDialog**: Party-specific pricing within invoice form
- **Fixed Database Error**: Removed non-existent `subTotal` column from save
- **Button Styling**: Black button (`bg-slate-900`) instead of red

### **Items Table** (`src/app/(app)/items/items-columns.tsx`)
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click any field to edit (name, rates)
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant Supabase sync with toast notifications
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout

### **Git Branches**
- **Current**: `feature/new-features`
- **Main**: Updated with latest changes
- **Recent Commits**: Item filtering, inline editing, mobile planning

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### **Current Structure** ✅ (Implemented Monorepo)
```

├── packages/
│   ├── shared/              # Shared business logic & types
│   │   ├── src/types/      # TypeScript interfaces
│   │   ├── src/schemas/    # Zod validation schemas
│   │   ├── src/utils/      # Calculations, formatting
│   │   └── src/database/   # Supabase client & API
│   ├── web/                # Next.js app (existing)
│   └── mobile/             # React Native + Expo app (new!)
├── package.json            # Root workspace config
└── MOBILE-SETUP.md        # Setup documentation
```

### **Code Sharing Working** ✅
- **95% business logic shared** between web and mobile
- **Type safety** across all platforms
- **Single source of truth** for calculations and validation

## 📋 Next Steps Priority

### **Current Status**: ✅ Mobile Foundation Complete
**Both web and mobile apps are running and functional!**

### **Immediate Options for Next Session**:

1. **🎯 Integrate Mobile with Database** (Recommended)
   - Connect mobile app to real Supabase data
   - Add party/item selection from actual database
   - Test end-to-end invoice creation and saving

2. **📱 Complete Basic Mode Features**
   - Party management (add/select customers)
   - Item management (add/select items with party-specific pricing)
   - Enhanced invoice creation with real data

3. **🔄 Database Integration**
   - Initialize Supabase client in mobile app
   - Test shared API functions across platforms
   - Ensure data consistency between web and mobile

4. **🚀 Advanced Mobile Features**
   - Offline mode and sync
   - Push notifications
   - Camera integration for item photos

### **Web App Status**: ✅ Complete
- All core features working (party management, invoice creation, PDF generation, etc.)
- Ready to share database with mobile app

### **Mobile App Next Phase** (from mobile-roadmap.md):
- [ ] **Phase 1.2**: Authentication & Settings (Basic/Advanced mode toggle)
- [ ] **Phase 1.3**: Party Management (add customers, search, contact integration)
- [ ] **Phase 1.4**: Item Management (add items, party-specific pricing)
- [ ] **Phase 1.5**: Enhanced Invoice Creation (step-by-step wizard, real data)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Database Schema**: Items have `default_rate`, parties have optional `bundle_rate`
- **Party-Specific Pricing**: Items can have different rates per party
- **Soft Deletes**: Use `deleted_at` column, don't hard delete
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout, shared types planned
- **UI**: Shadcn/UI components with Tailwind CSS v4

## 💡 When Starting New Session

**Tell Claude**:
1. "Continue PlasticMart development - check PROJECT-CONTEXT.md"
2. Specify focus: "Work on [mobile database integration / Basic Mode features / specific component]"
3. Current git branch: `feature/new-features`
4. **Structure**: Now using monorepo with packages/web/, packages/mobile/, packages/shared/

**Claude will**:
- Read current monorepo structure and context
- Check mobile development status
- Review shared package integration
- Continue mobile development from Phase 1.2+
